    description : "GeneA connects to GeneB if GeneA is a Transcription Factor (TF) that is shown to interact with GeneB (which may or may not be a TF). This dataset contains literature mined and manually curated TF regulatory interactions for A.thaliana. Started from 1701 TFs from PlantTFDB 2.0 and retrieved 4663 TF-associated interactions. These were manually filtered (e.g. FPs, PPI interactions removed). They then added some from other sources. Final result is 1431 confirmed TF regulatory interactions, of which 637 are TF-TF.
