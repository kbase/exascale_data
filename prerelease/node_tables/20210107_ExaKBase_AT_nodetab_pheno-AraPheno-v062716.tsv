As2	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:103		bacterial disease resistance	The resistance exhibited by a plant or a group of plants (population) in response to the disease caused by a bacterial pathogen infection as compared to the susceptible and/or the reference plants of the same species. [GR:pj]	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08800
As75	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:67	Arsenic concentrations in leaves, grown in soil. Elemental analysis was performed with an ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Sample normalized to calculated weights as described in Baxter et al., 2008	arsenic concentration	A mineral and ion content related trait (TO:0000465) which is the concentration of arsenic (CHEBI:22632) in some plant structure (PO:0009011).

At2	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:83		bacterial disease resistance	The resistance exhibited by a plant or a group of plants (population) in response to the disease caused by a bacterial pathogen infection as compared to the susceptible and/or the reference plants of the same species. [GR:pj]	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08800
Co59	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:22	Cobalt concentrations in leaves, grown in soil. Elemental analysis was performed with an ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Sample normalized to calculated weights as described in Baxter et al., 2008	cobalt concentration	A mineral and ion content related trait (TO:0000465) which is the concentration of cobalt (CHEBI:33888) in some plant structure (PO:0009011).

Mo98	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:73	Molybdenum concentrations in leaves, grown in soil. Elemental analysis was performed with an ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Sample normalized to calculated weights as described in Baxter et al., 2008	molybdenum concentration	A mineral and ion content related trait (TO:0000465) which is the concentration of molybdenum (CHEBI:25370) in some plant structure (PO:0009011). [GR:Karthik]	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08800
Na23	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:5	Sodium concentrations in leaves, grown in soil. Elemental analysis was performed with an ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Sample normalized to calculated weights as described in Baxter et al., 2008	sodium concentration	The total sodium ion concentration measured in a given volume of a plant or a plant part or plant extract.

SDV	pheno	10.21958/phenotype:104	Number of days following stratification to opening of first flower. The experiment was stopped at 200 d, and accessions that had not flowered at that point were assigned a value of 200	days to flowering trait	A flowering time trait (TO:0002616)which is the number of days required for an individual flower (PO:0009046), a whole plant (PO:0000003) or a plant population to reach flowering stage (PO:0007616) from a predetermined time point (e.g. the date of seed sowing, seedling transplant, or seedling emergence).
